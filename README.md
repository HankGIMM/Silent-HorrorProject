# Silent-HorrorProject
Our main goal should be to have fun and to expand our skills to be proficient at whatever game design skill you want to improve on. No matter your skill level, whether that is increasing your skills as an artist, a programmer, a sound designer, etc. This project should be used as a testing ground for our skills learned in class or learned through this project.
